				A modal (also called a modal window or lightbox)
				is a web page element that displays in front of
				and deactivates all other page content. 
			</p>	
			<p>
				To return
				to the main content, the user must engage with the
				modal by completing an action or by closing it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Modals are often used to direct users attention to
				an important action or piece of information on a website or
				application.
			</p>
			<p>
				The purpose of modals can be summed up in one word: focus.
